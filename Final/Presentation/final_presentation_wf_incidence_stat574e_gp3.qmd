## Wildfire Incidence in Arizona

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
Our project investigates different approaches to spatial statistical modeling of wildfire incidence data in Arizona, with a focus on Coconino County (Northern AZ). 

The "Wildfire Incidence" data we will be studying specifies coordinates for a fire's origin, and its resulting size in acres.

Overall practical goal: modeling wildfire incidence to aid in prediction/assessment of wildfire risks in AZ based on relevant information.

Our incidence data uses the **National Interagency Fire Center** [Wildland Fire Incident Locations](https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/b4402f7887ca4ea9a6189443f220ef28_0/explore?location=-0.000000%2C0.000000%2C1.38) dataset. 

This dataset includes point locations and corresponding data for all wildland fires in the United States reported to the [IRWIN system](https://www.wildfire.gov/application/irwin-integrated-reporting-wildfire-information), which aggregates wildfire incidence data from around the country. 

The dataset has all IRWIN data entries since 2014 (it is still updated daily).

There are over 300K records in this dataset, and just over 18K in Arizona.

Refinement of this dataset utilized the following data attributes (of 96 columns) for incidence filtering & covariates.

- `IncidentSize` | Size of the resulting wildfire in acres
- `FireCause` | Human, Natural, Unknown, Undetermined
- `FireDiscoveryDateTime` | Date & time of incident reporting
- `IncidentTypeCategory` | WF (wildfire) or RX (prescribed burn)
- `x` and `y` | Spatial coordinates in lat/lon

## Wildfire Incidence Data - Continuous, Fixed Spatial Index

This dataset offered us a unique opportunity to take multiple approaches to spatial statistical modeling. Using the available data attributes, we can approach our data from different angles.

 - **Continuous, fixed** - Treating `x` and `y` as coordinates as fixed and using `IncidentSize` as a continuous response, our data is geostatistical.
 
. . .

#### Modeling approach

- **Spatial Linear Model** - Module 2, similar to Holland example in *Continuously indexed spatial data (geostatistics)*, or the `dioxane` analysis in HW2.

$$
\boldsymbol{\mathrm{y}}=\boldsymbol{\mathrm{X}}^{T}\boldsymbol{\beta}+\boldsymbol{e}\,\,\,\,\boldsymbol{e}\sim\mathrm{N}(\boldsymbol{0},\Sigma(\boldsymbol{\theta}))
$$

## Wildfire Incidence Data - Point Process 1

This dataset offered us a unique opportunity to take multiple approaches to spatial statistical modeling. Using the available data attributes, we can approach our data from different angles.

 - **Point process** - Using `x` and `y` as coordinates and `IncidentSize` as a *threshold*, we can study "large wildfires" (`IncidentSize` $\geq 1000$ acres) as point process data. 
 
. . .


#### Modeling approach

- **Log-Gaussian Cox Process** Module 4, similar to Gorillas LGCP example in *Random spatial index (point pattern)*, or the `earthquakes_um` analysis of Kansas in HW4.

$$
\log(\lambda(u))=\mathrm{\boldsymbol{Z}}(u)\boldsymbol{\beta}+e(u),\,\,\,\,e(u)\sim\mathrm{N}(0,C(\boldsymbol{\theta})),\,\,\,\,C(u,u')=\sigma^{2}e^{-||u-u'||/h}

#### Modeling approach

- **Binary Response Spatial Logistic Regression** - Module 5, similar to Gorillas Logistic Regression GLM example in *Non-Gaussian spatial data*.

$$
\mathrm{logit}(\lambda_{1}(\mathrm{\boldsymbol{s}}))=\boldsymbol{\mathrm{x}}(\mathrm{\boldsymbol{s}})^{T}\boldsymbol{\beta}+e(\mathrm{\boldsymbol{s}})+\log(\lambda_{0}),
$$ 

::: {.smallmath}
$$
Y(\boldsymbol{s}) \sim \mathrm{Bern}(p(\boldsymbol{s})),\,\,\,\, \mathrm{E}[ Y (\boldsymbol{s}) ] = p(\boldsymbol{s}) = \frac{\lambda_{1}(\boldsymbol{s})}{\lambda_{0}(\boldsymbol{s})+\lambda_{1}(\boldsymbol{s})}

## Research Questions (1)



#### Does the proximity of a wildfireâ€™s origin to a road influence its resulting size?

![All wildfires](images/az_rd_proximity1.png){#fig-wfpoints width=40% .lightbox}

![Proximity to major roads](images/az_rd_proximity2.png){#fig-wfpointsrds width=40% .lightbox}

Reasearch question 1 framework

:::

Data explorations showed some clear wildfire patterns near roads (the outlines are visible). We wanted to include the distance in meters to the nearest major roads (and "remote" roads) as usable predictors. For each point, the `roads()` function in the `tigris` package to generate `sf` objects for AZ roads, and `st_distance()` function in the `sf` package helped us generate this data to be used as a covariate.

## Modeling - Coconino County
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

We opted to focus our modeling efforts on Coconino County based on some inital model fits, and overall size of the dataset. 

Coconino County is home to national forests like Coconino, Kaibab, and Apache-Sitgreaves, and has the most wildfire incidence in the state by a good margin.

## Spatial Linear Model approach

- **Spatial Linear Model** - use the continuous, fixed response data to fit a spatial linear model to predict resulting model size for input points and covariate data.

$$
\boldsymbol{\mathrm{y}}=\boldsymbol{\mathrm{X}}^{T}\boldsymbol{\beta}+\boldsymbol{e}\,\,\,\,\boldsymbol{e}\sim\mathrm{N}(\boldsymbol{0},\Sigma(\boldsymbol{\theta}))
$$

- How you landed on the model you did (AIC, other analysis)
- Any data filtering you did, variable transformations
- Point estimates and Confidence  intervals on fixed effects
- Fit parameters for spatial variance (nugget, range, sill)
    - de (sill), ie (nugget), range (range)

- `loocv`, diagnostic plots?
- Visuals (ESV, relevant exploration images, etc)
- What might be the practical applications of this model? 

## LGCP Modeling Approach

### *Make sure to include CSR analysis to address RQ3*

- **Log-Gaussian Cox Process** Treat large wildfire ($\geq1000$ acres) incidence locations as arising from a random intensity surface and fit LGCP model accounting for fixed effects and spatial dependence

$$
\log(\lambda(u))=\mathrm{\boldsymbol{Z}}(u)\boldsymbol{\beta}+e(u),\,\,\,\,e(u)\sim\mathrm{N}(0,C(\boldsymbol{\theta})),\,\,\,\,C(u,u')=\sigma^{2}e^{-||u-u'||/h}
$$

- How you landed on the model you did (AIC, other analysis)

## Binary GLM Spatial approach

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

We now want to study risk of occurence of large wildfire (`Indidentsize`$\geq 1000$ acres) spatially in terms of probabilities. We will also restrict occurrences to `FireCause=="Natural"`. 

To build the model, we filter the data and treat large wildfire incident locations as a realization of a point process with intensity surface $\lambda_1(\mathrm{\boldsymbol{s}})$. For these points, we assign a response value of $Y(\boldsymbol{s})=1$ (`Wildfires`).

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

::: {.smallmath}
$$
\mathrm{logit}(\lambda_{1}(\mathrm{\boldsymbol{s}}))=\boldsymbol{\mathrm{x}}(\mathrm{\boldsymbol{s}})^{T}\boldsymbol{\beta}+\underset{\text{spatial effect}}{\underbrace{e(\mathrm{\boldsymbol{s}})}}+\log(\lambda_{0}),
$$ 
:::

::: {.smallmath}
$$
Y(\boldsymbol{s}) \sim \mathrm{Bern}(p(\boldsymbol{s})),
$$
:::

::: {.smallmath}
$$
\mathrm{E}[ Y (\boldsymbol{s}) ] = p(\boldsymbol{s}) = \frac{\lambda_{1}(\boldsymbol{s})}{\lambda_{0}(\boldsymbol{s})+\lambda_{1}(\boldsymbol{s})}

Next we generate a background realization of a known constant Poisson process $\lambda_0$, which represent locations that a large wildfire could have happened but did not. For these points, we assign a response value of $Y(\boldsymbol{s})=0$  (`Wildfires`).

## Binary GLM Spatial approach

Our model can then be built using selected covariates we desire for predictors and performing a binary logistic regression. The resulting prediction model will return the probability of the occurrence of a large wildfire for a given input location and corresponding values for the model's chosen covariates.

##### Model Selection

The selection of covariates of the model utilized a semi-automated process that minimized AIC. There were some issues with model convergence for some spatial covariance fits, and AIC did not necessarily favor significant predictors in the end.

```r
spglm_formula <- Wildfires ~  I(sqrt(distance_rd_min_isprisec)) + pop.density +
  Precipitation_Buffered * Temp_Min_Buffered + I(get_season(FireDiscoveryDateTime)) +
  mean_grass * mean_forest

az_wf_spcov <- spcov_initial("wave")

az_wf_spglm <- spglm(spglm_formula, data = model_data_sf, 
                     family = binomial, spcov_initial = az_wf_spcov)
```
::: {.smallmath}
*The best AIC model tested utilized square root minimum distance from major roads, population density data at the coordinates, interactions of environmental factors, and season.*
