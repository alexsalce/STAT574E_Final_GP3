Wildifres in Arizona
:::

Our project investigates different approaches to wildfire incidence data in Arizona, with a focus on Coconino County (Northern AZ).

The "Wildfire Incidence" data we will be studying specifies coordinates for a fire's origin, and its resulting size in acres.

Our incidence data uses the full **National Interagency Fire Center** [Wildland Fire Incident Locations](https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/b4402f7887ca4ea9a6189443f220ef28_0/explore?location=-0.000000%2C0.000000%2C1.38) dataset, and

## Wildfire Incidence Data

Studying wildfire incidence in AZ using two primary approaches to data

 - Continuous, fixed
 - Point process

### Filter

  - Coconino county
  - Discard unknown cause

### Research Questions

(1) Does the proximity of a wildfireâ€™s origin to a road influence its resulting size?

(2) Can spatial natural/human factors serve as useful predictors in modeling resulting wildfire size?

(3) Are the patterns of human or non human caused fires spatially CSR, or do they exhibit an inhomogeneous spatial intensity?


## Covariates

  - Roads
  - Environmental
    - Temp, Precipitation, Terrain, Plant cover (trees, brush, etc.)
