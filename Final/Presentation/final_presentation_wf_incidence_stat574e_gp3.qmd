## Wildfire Incidence in Arizona

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

Our project investigates different approaches to spatial statistical modeling of wildfire incidence data in Arizona, with a focus on Coconino County (Northern AZ). 

The "Wildfire Incidence" data we will be studying specifies coordinates for a fire's origin, and its resulting size in acres.

Overall practical goal: modeling wildfire incidence to aid in prediction/assessment of wildfire risks in AZ based on relevant information.

Our incidence data uses the **National Interagency Fire Center** [Wildland Fire Incident Locations](https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/b4402f7887ca4ea9a6189443f220ef28_0/explore?location=-0.000000%2C0.000000%2C1.38) dataset. 

This dataset includes point locations and corresponding data for all wildland fires in the United States reported to the [IRWIN system](https://www.wildfire.gov/application/irwin-integrated-reporting-wildfire-information), which aggregates wildfire incidence data from around the country. 

The dataset has all IRWIN data entries since 2014 (it is still updated daily).

There are over 300K records in this dataset, and just over 18K in Arizona.

Refinement of this dataset utilized the following data attributes (of 96 columns) for incidence filtering & covariates.

- `IncidentSize` | Size of the resulting wildfire in acres
- `FireCause` | Human, Natural, Unknown, Undetermined
- `FireDiscoveryDateTime` | Date & time of incident reporting
- `IncidentTypeCategory` | WF (wildfire) or RX (prescribed burn)
- `x` and `y` | Spatial coordinates in lat/lon

## Wildfire Incidence Data - Continuous, Fixed Spatial Index

This dataset offered us a unique opportunity to take multiple approaches to spatial statistical modeling. Using the available data attributes, we can treat our response data in two distinct ways

 - **Continuous, fixed** - Using `x` and `y` as coordinates and `IncidentSize` as response, we can treat wildfire incidence as fixed, continuous data.
 
. . .

#### Modeling approach

- **Spatial Linear Model** - Module 2, similar to Holland example in *Continuously indexed spatial data (geostatistics)*, or the `dioxane` analysis in HW2.

$$
\boldsymbol{\mathrm{y}}=\boldsymbol{\mathrm{X}}^{T}\boldsymbol{\beta}+\boldsymbol{e}\,\,\,\,\boldsymbol{e}\sim\mathrm{N}(\boldsymbol{0},\Sigma(\boldsymbol{\theta}))
$$

## Wildfire Incidence Data - Point Process 1

This dataset offered us a unique opportunity to take multiple approaches to spatial statistical modeling. Using the available data attributes, we can treat our response data in two distinct ways

 - **Point process** - Using `x` and `y` as coordinates and `IncidentSize` as a *threshold*, we can study "large wildfires" (`IncidentSize` $\geq 1000$ acres) as point process data. We can also filter by `FireCause` (Human or Natural).
 
. . .


#### Modeling approach

- **Log-Gaussian Cox Process** Module 4, similar to Gorillas LGCP example in *Random spatial index (point pattern)*, or the `earthquakes_um` analysis of Kansas in HW4.

$$
\log(\lambda(u))=\mathrm{\boldsymbol{Z}}(u)\boldsymbol{\beta}+e(u),\,\,\,\,e(u)\sim\mathrm{N}(0,C(\boldsymbol{\theta})),\,\,\,\,C(u,u')=\sigma^{2}e^{-||u-u'||/h}
$$

 - **Point process** - Using `x` and `y` as coordinates and `IncidentSize` as a *threshold*, we can study "large wildfires" (`IncidentSize` $\geq 1000$ acres) as point process data. We can also filter by `FireCause` (Human or Natural).
 
. . .


#### Modeling approach

- **Binary GLM Spatial Logistic Regression** - Module 5, similar to Gorillas Logistic Regression GLM example in *Non-Gaussian spatial data*.

$$
\mathrm{logit}(\lambda_{1}(\mathrm{\boldsymbol{s}}))=\boldsymbol{\mathrm{x}}(\mathrm{\boldsymbol{s}})^{T}\boldsymbol{\beta}+e(\mathrm{\boldsymbol{s}})+\log(\lambda_{0}),
$$ 

$$
Y(\boldsymbol{s}) \sim \mathrm{Bern}(p(\boldsymbol{s})),\,\,\,\, \mathrm{E}[ Y (\boldsymbol{s}) ] = p(\boldsymbol{s}) = \frac{\lambda_{1}(\boldsymbol{s})}{\lambda_{0}(\boldsymbol{s})+\lambda_{1}(\boldsymbol{s})}
$$

## Research Questions



#### (1) Does the proximity of a wildfireâ€™s origin to a road influence its resulting size?

Reasearch question 1 framework

:::

Data explorations showed some clear wildfire patterns near roads (the outlines are visible). We wanted to include the distance to the nearest major roads (and "remote" roads) as usable predictors. For each point, the `roads()` function in the `tigris` package and `st_distance()` function in the `sf` package helped us generate this data.



## Research Questions


#### (2) Can spatial natural/human factors serve as useful predictors in modeling resulting wildfire size?

(3) Are the patterns of human or non human caused fires spatially CSR, or do they exhibit an inhomogeneous spatial intensity?

## Modeling approach

- **Spatial Linear Model** - use the continuous, fixed response data to fit a spatial linear model to predict resulting model size for input points and covariate data.

$$
\boldsymbol{\mathrm{y}}=\boldsymbol{\mathrm{X}}^{T}\boldsymbol{\beta}+\boldsymbol{e}\,\,\,\,\boldsymbol{e}\sim\mathrm{N}(\boldsymbol{0},\Sigma(\boldsymbol{\theta}))
$$

## Modeling approach

- **Log-Gaussian Cox Process** Treat large wildfire ($\geq1000$ acres) incidence locations as arising from a random intensity surface and fit LGCP model accounting for fixed effects and spatial dependence

$$
\log(\lambda(u))=\mathrm{\boldsymbol{Z}}(u)\boldsymbol{\beta}+e(u),\,\,\,\,e(u)\sim\mathrm{N}(0,C(\boldsymbol{\theta})),\,\,\,\,C(u,u')=\sigma^{2}e^{-||u-u'||/h}
$$


## Modeling approach

- **Binary GLM Spatial Logistic Regression** - Treat large wildfire incidence as realization of a point process $\lambda_1$ (response value$=1$) and generate constant background process $\lambda_0$ (response value$=0$). Perform binary logistic regression to model probability of large wildfire incidence for a point and chosen predctors

$$
\mathrm{logit}(\lambda_{1}(\mathrm{\boldsymbol{s}}))=\boldsymbol{\mathrm{x}}(\mathrm{\boldsymbol{s}})^{T}\boldsymbol{\beta}+e(\mathrm{\boldsymbol{s}})+\log(\lambda_{0})
$$
